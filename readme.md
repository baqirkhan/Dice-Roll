# Dice Roll

This project is part of my attempt to build frontend application
using mordern tools like SASS but also building strong
basics of vanilla JavaScript.

This project is entirely built by using vanilla JS and
uses SCSS for stylesheets.

### What is Dice Roll?

This project is a small game of luck that can be
players, where:

1. A player wins if his overall score is greater than 30 or other player got 1 while rolling the dice
2. A player can roll the dice as many as they want as long as they don't get a 1. If they get a 1, they loose.
3. To hold the current score, press hold and then the other player will get a chance to play

Although, this is a learning project, but please feel free to add any suggestions or bug fixes.
